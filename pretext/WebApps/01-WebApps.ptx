        <title>Web Applications</title>
        <p>In this chapter, you will learn how to create web applications in Python. There are two kinds of web
            applications &#8211; &#8220;client side&#8221; web applications and &#8220;server side&#8221; web applications. You&#8217;ve probably used
            both kinds in your travels on the World-Wide Web.</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><alert>Client-side</alert> web applications are programs that are downloaded to a web browser and executed on
                    the user&#8217;s local machine. Client-side applications are typically written in JavaScript and embedded
                    in web pages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><alert>Server-side</alert> web applications are programs that run on web server computers, rather than on the
                    user&#8217;s local machine. Typically, a server-side web application displays a form with text boxes and
                    other data collection mechanisms. The user fills out the form, clicks a submit button, and the
                    browser sends the form to the web application on the server, which processes the request, and responds
                    with another web page. If you&#8217;ve ever shopped online, you&#8217;ve used a server-side web application.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>In this chapter, you will learn to build server-side web applications, which I will refer to simply as &#8220;web
            applications.&#8221;</p>
