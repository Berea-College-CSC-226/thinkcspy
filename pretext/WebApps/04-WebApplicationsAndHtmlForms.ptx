        <title>Web Applications and HTML Forms</title>
        <p>Perhaps you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;I don&#8217;t usually perform searches by typing in URL&#8217;s &#8212; I fill out a search form.&#8221;
            True &#8212; if web applications forced users to interact with them by entering query strings, the World-Wide
            Web would be a much less popular place.</p>
        <p>Let&#8217;s explore the relationship between forms and query strings a bit. Bring up the Google home page (I&#8217;ll wait):</p>
        <block_quote>
            <p><url href="https://google.com" visual="https://google.com">https://google.com</url></p>
        </block_quote>
        <p>Now, type in your query. When I type in &#8220;Microsoft&#8221; and click Search, here is what I see:</p>
        <figure>
            <image source="WebApps/Figures/googlesearchresults.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Now, take a good look at the URL in the title bar &#8212; notice the query string? It&#8217;s a bit more complicated
            than the one I had you create by hand earlier. But you can probably pick out the &#8220;q=Microsoft&#8221; if you
            look closely. How did all of that get there? Well, when you clicked Search, the browser took the information
            you typed into the form, packaged it up into a query string, and transmitted it to the Google web
            server. You see, when you fill out a form on a web page and click Submit, the browser uses the form
            data to construct a URL, and then sends a normal request to the web server.</p>
        <p>Even if you&#8217;re a novice at writing <alert>HTML pages</alert>, it&#8217;s not hard to learn to create HTML forms. Take a look
            at this simplified version of the Google home page:</p>
        <program language="html"><input>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Google&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div align="center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://www.google.com/images/logo.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;form action="https://google.com/search"&gt;
      Enter your search words: &lt;input type="text" name="q"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" name="btnG" value="Google Search"&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</input></program>
        <p>Focus on the region of this example in between the &lt;form&gt; tags. Here&#8217;s a quick overview of this part
            of the page:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>The form is the region of the page in between the &lt;form&gt; and &lt;/form&gt; tags.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The form can contain a mixture of text, regular HTML formatting tags, and form &lt;input&gt; tags</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Each <c>&lt;input&gt;</c> tag has a <c>type</c> and a <c>name</c> attribute. The <c>type</c> attribute specifies what kind of input area
                    it is (&#8220;text&#8221; for a text box, &#8220;submit&#8221; for submit button, etc.). The <c>name</c> attribute specifies a name for
                    the input area.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the user fills out the form and clicks the submit button, the browser constructs a URL by taking
                    the form&#8217;s <c>action</c> attribute (<url href="https://google.com/search" visual="https://google.com/search">https://google.com/search</url>), appending a ?, and constructing the
                    query string using the names of the form input areas, together with the data entered by the user.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Try it out! Using Notepad, type in this example, and save it as googleform.html. Open it in your browser;
            you should see something like this:</p>
        <figure>
            <image source="WebApps/Figures/googleform.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Fill out the form, and, if Google still works as it did when this chapter was written, you should see
            search results appear in your browser.</p>
