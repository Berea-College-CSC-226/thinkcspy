        <title>Fetching Something From The Web</title>
        <p>The Python libraries are pretty messy in places. But here is a very simple example that copies
            the contents at some web URL to a local file. We will need to get a few things right before this works:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>The resource we&#8217;re trying to fetch must exist! Check this using a browser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We&#8217;ll need permission to write to the destination filename, and the file will be created in the &#8220;current directory&#8221; - i.e. the same folder that the Python program is saved in.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If we are behind a proxy server that requires authentication, (as some students are), this may require some more special handling to work around our proxy. Use a local resource for the purpose of this demonstration!</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>We will try to retrieve the content of the HTML of this page as in the following code.</p>
