        <p>We will now use this file as input in a program that will do some data
            processing. In the program, we will <strong>read</strong> each line of the file and
            print it with some additional text. Because text files are sequences of
            lines of text, we can use the <emphasis>for</emphasis> loop to iterate through each line of
            the file.</p>
        <p>A <strong>line</strong> of a file is defined to be a sequence of characters up to and
            including a special character called the <strong>newline</strong> character. If you
            evaluate a string that contains a newline character you will see the
            character represented as <c>\n</c>. If you print a string that contains a
            newline you will not see the <c>\n</c>, you will just see its effects. When
            you are typing a Python program and you press the enter or return key on
            your keyboard, the editor inserts a newline character into your text at
            that point.</p>
        <p>As the <emphasis>for</emphasis> loop iterates through each line of the file the loop
            variable will contain the current line of the file as a string of
            characters. The general pattern for processing each line of a text file
            is as follows:</p>
        <pre>for line in myFile:
    statement1
    statement2
    ...</pre>
        <p>To process all of our climate change data, we will use a <emphasis>for</emphasis> loop to iterate over the lines of the file. Using
            the <c>split</c> method, we can break each line into a list containing all the fields of interest about climate
            change. We can then take the values corresponding to year, global average temperature, and global emmisions to
            construct a simple sentence.</p>

        <input>
ccfile = open("ccdata.txt", "r")

for aline in ccfile:
    values = aline.split()
    print('In', values[0], 'the average temp. was', values[1], '&#176;C and CO2 emmisions were', values[2], 'gigatons.')

ccfile.close()
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <note>
            <p>You can obtain a line from the keyboard with the <c>input</c> function, and you can process lines of a file.
                However &#8220;line&#8221; is used differently:  With <c>input</c> Python reads through the newline you enter from the keyboard,
                but the newline (<c>'\n'</c>) is <emphasis>not</emphasis> included in the line returned by <c>input</c>. It is dropped.
                When a line is taken from a file, the terminating newline <emphasis>is</emphasis> included as the last character (unless you
                are reading the final line of a file that happens to not have a newline at the end).</p>
        </note>
        <p>In the climate change example it is irrelevant whether the final line has a newline character at the end or not,
            since it would be stripped off by the <c>split</c> method call.</p>
