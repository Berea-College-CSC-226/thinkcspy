        <title>Nested conditionals</title>
        <p>One conditional can also be <alert>nested</alert> within another. For example, assume we have two integer variables, <c>x</c> and <c>y</c>.
            The following pattern of selection shows how we might decide how they are related to each other.</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
if x &lt; y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    if x &gt; y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x and y must be equal")
</input></program>
        <p>The outer conditional contains two branches.
            The second branch (the else from the outer) contains another <c>if</c> statement, which
            has two branches of its own. Those two branches could contain
            conditional statements as well.</p>
        <p>The flow of control for this example can be seen in this flowchart illustration.</p>
        <image source="Selection/Figures/flowchart_nested_conditional.png"/>
        <p>Here is a complete program that defines values for <c>x</c> and <c>y</c>.  Run the program and see the result.  Then change the values of the variables to change the flow of control.</p>

    <program xml:id="sel2_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
x = 10
y = 10

if x &lt; y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    if x &gt; y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x and y must be equal")
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <note>
            <p>In some programming languages, matching the if and the else is a problem.  However, in Python this is not the case.
                The indentation pattern tells us exactly which else
                belongs to which if.</p>
        </note>
        <p>If you are still a bit unsure, here is the same selection as part of a codelens example.  Step through it to see how the correct <c>print</c> is chosen.</p>

        <statement>

        <p>Will the following code cause an error?</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
x = -10
if x &lt; 0:
    print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
else:
    if x &gt; 0:
        print(x, " is a positive number")
    else:
        print(x," is 0")

                <statement>
                    <p>No</p>

                <feedback>
                    This is a legal nested if-else statement.  The inner if-else statement is contained completely within the body of the outer else-block.
                </feedback>
            </choice>
