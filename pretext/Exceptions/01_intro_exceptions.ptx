        <title>What is an exception?</title>
        <p>An <emphasis>exception</emphasis> is a signal that a condition has occurred that can&#8217;t be easily
            handled using the normal flow-of-control of a Python program. <emphasis>Exceptions</emphasis>
            are often defined as being &#8220;errors&#8221; but this is not always the case. All
            errors in Python are dealt with using <emphasis>exceptions</emphasis>, but not all
            <emphasis>exceptions</emphasis> are errors.</p>
