        <title>String Comparison</title>
        <p>The comparison operators also work on strings. To see if two strings are equal you simply write a boolean
            expression using the equality operator.</p>

            This is similar to the alphabetical order you would use with a dictionary,
            except that all the uppercase letters come before all the lowercase letters.</p>

        <p>It is probably clear to you that the word <title_reference>apple</title_reference> would be less than (come before) the word <c>banana</c>.
            After all, <title_reference>a</title_reference> is before <title_reference>b</title_reference> in the alphabet.  But what if we consider the words <c>apple</c> and <c>Apple</c>?
            Are they the same?</p>

        <p>It turns out, as you recall from our discussion of variable names, that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered to be different from one another.  The way the computer knows they are different is that
            each character is assigned a unique integer value.  &#8220;A&#8221; is 65, &#8220;B&#8221; is 66, and &#8220;5&#8221; is 53.  The way you can
            find out the so-called <strong>ordinal value</strong> for a given character is to use a character function called <c>ord</c>.</p>

    <program xml:id="ch08_ord2_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
print(ord("A"))
print(ord("B"))
print(ord("5"))

print(ord("a"))
print("apple" &gt; "Apple")
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <p>When you compare characters or strings to one another, Python converts the characters into their equivalent ordinal values and compares the integers from left to right.  As you can see from the example above, &#8220;a&#8221; is greater than &#8220;A&#8221; so &#8220;apple&#8221; is greater than &#8220;Apple&#8221;.</p>
        <p>Humans commonly ignore capitalization when comparing two words.  However, computers do not.  A common way to address this issue is to convert strings to a standard
            format, such as all lowercase, before performing the comparison.</p>
        <p>There is also a similar function called <c>chr</c> that converts integers into their character equivalent.</p>

        <p>One thing to note in the last two examples is the fact that the space character has an ordinal value (32).  Even though you don&#8217;t see it, it is an actual character.  We sometimes call it a <emphasis>nonprinting</emphasis> character.</p>
