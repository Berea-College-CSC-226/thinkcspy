        <title>Strings are Immutable</title>
        <p>One final thing that makes strings different from some other Python collection types is that
            you are not allowed to modify the individual characters in the collection.  It is tempting to use the <c>[]</c> operator on the left side of an assignment,
            with the intention of changing a character in a string.  For example, in the following code, we would like to change the first letter of <c>greeting</c>.</p>

<listing xml:id="cg08_imm1">
    <caption/>
    <program xml:id="cg08_imm1_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
greeting = "Hello, world!"
greeting[0] = 'J'            # ERROR!
print(greeting)
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <p>Instead of producing the output <c>Jello, world!</c>, this code produces the
            runtime error <c>TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment</c>.</p>
        <p>Strings are <alert>immutable</alert>, which means you cannot change an existing string. The
            best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original.</p>

<listing xml:id="ch08_imm2">
    <caption/>
    <program xml:id="ch08_imm2_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
greeting = "Hello, world!"
newGreeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
print(newGreeting)
print(greeting)            # same as it was
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <p>The solution here is to concatenate a new first letter onto a slice of
            <c>greeting</c>. This operation has no effect on the original string.</p>
