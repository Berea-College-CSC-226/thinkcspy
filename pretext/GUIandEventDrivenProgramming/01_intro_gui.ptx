        <title>Graphical User Interfaces</title>
        <p>A <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI) allows a user
            to interact with a computer program using a pointing device that manipulates
            small pictures on a computer screen. The small pictures are called <c>icons</c> or
            <c>widgets</c>. Various types of pointing devices can be used, such as a mouse,
            a stylus pen, or a human finger on a touch screen.</p>
        <p>We refer to programs that use a <strong>graphical user interface</strong> as &#8220;GUI programs.&#8221;
            A GUI program is very different from a program that uses a <strong>command line interface</strong>
            which receives user input from typed characters on a keyboard.
            Typically programs that use a <strong>command line interface</strong> perform a series of
            tasks in a predetermined order and then terminate.
            However, a GUI program
            creates the <c>icons</c> and <c>widgets</c> that are displayed to a user and then it
            simply waits for the user to interact with them. The order that tasks are
            performed by the program is under the user&#8217;s control &#8211; not the program&#8217;s control!
            This means a GUI program must keep track of the &#8220;state&#8221; of its processing
            and respond correctly to user commands that are given in any order the user
            chooses. This style of programming is called &#8220;event driven programming.&#8221;
            In fact, by definition, all <emphasis>GUI programs</emphasis> are <emphasis>event-driven programs</emphasis>.</p>
