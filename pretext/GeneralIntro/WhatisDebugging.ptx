    <title>What is Debugging?</title>
    <p>
        Programming is a complex process.  Since it is done by human beings, errors may often occur.
            Programming errors are called
        <alert>bugs</alert>
        and the process
            of tracking them down and correcting them is called
        <alert>debugging</alert>
        .  Some claim
            that in 1945, a dead moth caused a problem on relay number 70, panel F, of one
            of the first computers at Harvard, and the term
        <alert>bug</alert>
        has remained in use
            since. For more about this historic event, see

        .

        Three kinds of errors can occur in a program:
        <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error" visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error">syntax errors</url>
        ,
        <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error" visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error">runtime errors</url>
        , and
        <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error" visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error">semantic errors</url>
        .  It is useful to distinguish
            between them in order to track them down more quickly.

                <statement>
                    <p>tracking down programming errors and correcting them.</p>

                    Programming errors are called bugs and the process of finding and removing them from a program is called debugging.

                    <p>removing all the bugs from your house.</p>

                    Maybe, but that is not what we are talking about in this context.

                <statement>
                    <p>finding all the bugs in the program.</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    This is partially correct.  But, debugging is more than just finding the bugs.  What do you need to do once you find them?

                    <p>fixing the bugs in the program.</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    This is partially correct.  But, debugging is more than just fixing the bugs. What do you need to do before you can fix them?
