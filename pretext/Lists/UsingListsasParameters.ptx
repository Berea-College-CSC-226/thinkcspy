        <title>Using Lists as Parameters</title>
        <p>Functions which take lists as arguments and change them during execution are
            called <strong>modifiers</strong> and the changes they make are called <strong>side effects</strong>.
            Passing a list as an argument actually passes a reference to the list, not a
            copy of the list. Since lists are mutable, changes made to the
            elements referenced by the parameter change
            the same list that the argument is referencing.
            For example, the function below takes a list as an
            argument and multiplies each element in the list by 2:</p>

<listing xml:id="chp09_parm1">
    <caption/>
    <program xml:id="chp09_parm1_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
def doubleStuff(aList):
    """ Overwrite each element in aList with double its value. """
    for position in range(len(aList)):
        aList[position] = 2 * aList[position]

things = [2, 5, 9]
print(things)
doubleStuff(things)
print(things)
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <p>The parameter <c>aList</c> and the variable <c>things</c> are aliases for the
            same object.</p>
        <image source="images/Lists/Figures/references4.png" alt="State snapshot for multiple references to a list as a parameter"/>
        <p>Since the list object is shared by two references, there is only one copy.
            If a function modifies the elements of a list parameter, the caller sees the change since the change
            is occurring to the original.</p>
        <p>This can be easily seen in codelens.  Note that after the call to <c>doubleStuff</c>, the formal parameter <c>aList</c> refers to the same object as the actual parameter <c>things</c>.  There is only one copy of the list object itself.</p>
